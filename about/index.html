		<p>Hi! My name is James and I love the internet. I graduated from The University of Akron in the Spring of
			2013 and presently reside in Akron, Ohio. On a daily basis I can be found working with
			JavaScript (plus HTML &amp; CSS of course) on the client side as well as C# (and occasionally Clojure & PHP)
			on the server side. When I'm not working exclusively native with those languages, I utilize a few
			frameworks depending on the project, such as ReactJS, AngularJS, BackboneJS KnockoutJS, Browserify, RequireJS, and ASP.NET.
			Iâ€™m constantly learning new things, so ES2015 (and beyond) features have been keeping me busy!</p>
