		<p>Hi! My name is James and I love all things web. I graduated from The University of Akron in the Spring of 2013 and haven't stopped learning since. Currently I'm working with languages/frameworks such as C#, AngularJS, CSS3, HTML5, and of course all the JavaScript goodness I can get my hands on!</p>
		<p>I work at <a href="http://www.veritix.com/" target="_blank">Veritix</a>, doing a ton of fun stuff, working primarily with C# (.Net), Xamarin (iOS &amp; Android development), as well as AngularJS and other front-end frameworks and languages.</p>

		<p>I'd consider myself to be a front-end developer, but my skills reach much further than that. I also enjoy UI &amp; UX design, including wireframing and mocking up designs as well as workflows. I'm in a constant state of learning, so you can catch me working on some <a href="http://github.com/jamez14" target="_blank">open source projects</a> or learning via a cool new tutorial. I also like to snowboard and ride my bike - so I do occasionally see the outdoors!</p>
