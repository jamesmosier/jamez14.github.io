		<p>Hi! My name is James and I love the internet. I graduated from The University of Akron in the Spring of 2013 and presently reside in Akron, Ohio. Currently I'm working with languages &amp; frameworks such as C# (ASP.NET), Xamarin, AngularJS, KnockoutJS, RequireJS, CSS3, HTML5, and a lot of other JavaScript related frameworks/libraries.</p>
		<p>I work at <a href="http://www.veritix.com/" target="_blank" title="Veritix.com">Veritix</a> where I get to work on a ton of fun stuff. Day-to-day I can be found working with C# (.NET), Xamarin (iOS &amp; Android development), as well as AngularJS, KnockoutJS and a host of other front-end frameworks and languages.</p>
