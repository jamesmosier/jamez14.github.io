	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
	<p>MrMichaelHurley.com was the personal portfolio and blog of Michael Hurley, Creative Director for NEXT & XHIBITION, two lifestyle stores in NE Ohio. This project began with Mike’s art direction, in which we identified his desires for the site as well as design choices. After the design was planning, I began mocking up designs and sending updates to Mike over the course of the project.</p>
	<p>I created his newly designed site using HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Bootstrap 3, and jQuery – with WordPress for the backend so Mike could manage it all. One of the most fun parts of building the website was using SVG to get the triangles for the list of his portfolio pieces. MrMichaelHurley.com is no longer live, although could possibly return one day...</p>
