	<p><a href="http://mrmichaelhurley.com" target="_blank">MrMichaelHurley.com</a> is the personal portfolio and blog of Michael Hurley, Creative Director for the NEXT clothing stores in NE Ohio. This project began with Mike’s art direction, in which we identified his desires for the site as well as design choices. After the design was planning, I began mocking up designs and sending updates to Mike over the course of the project.</p>
	<p>I created his newly designed site using HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Bootstrap 3, and jQuery – with WordPress for the backend so Mike could manage it. One of the most fun parts of building the website was using SVG techniques to get the triangles for the list of his portfolio pieces.</p>

		<!-- Mike has had his hand in starting a successful lifestyle boutique in Miami, FL – UNKNWN – which is partially owned by childhood friend Lebron James. Mike has also started and continues to manage many clothing brands, such as Blessed Label Clothing, VOID, plus his very own collection, the Mr. Michael Hurley Collection, which launched in the Spring of 2014. Mike has an ever growing portfolio, therefore <a href="http://mrmichaelhurley.com" target="_blank">MrMichaelHurley.com</a> is a platform for him to share his travels, tastes, and lifestyle with the world. -->
