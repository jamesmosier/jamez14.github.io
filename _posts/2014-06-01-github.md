  <p>My absolute favorite place to learn and contribute to the development community is on <a href="https://github.com/jamez14" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. For me, GitHub provides a place to track my progress as I learn new things, store personal projects that interest me, and also for work, managing issues and repos (although these are private repos) for the projects I'm on at Veritix, the company I work for. Much of the personal work I do on GitHub focuses on frontend development, although you'll find some C# and Xamarin repos hiding in there. Check out what I'm currently up to on my <a href="https://github.com/jamez14" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
