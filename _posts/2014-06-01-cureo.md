	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
	<p>I worked at <a href="http://cureo.com" target="_blank">Cureo</a> for over a year as a Software Engineer. As a developer there, I helped to develop a single page, ASP.NET MVC 5 application for the web (and mobile). My primary responsibilites involved front-end development but I also worked with everything from the business layer to the models. </p>
	<p>I had the opportunity to develop a new platform from the ground up with the team at Cureo. We began with a clean slate after a few months of my working there. I worked (and more importantly, learned) about every aspect of building a big application - from building business interfaces to designing the front-end.</p>
