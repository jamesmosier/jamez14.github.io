	<p><a href="https://github.com/realstrategos/JSLess" target="_blank">JSLess</a> is a custom JavaScript/jQuery framework written and used by the team at Cureo. The primary architect is Keith Kauffman and is supported by myself and the other team members while working on the Cureo application.</p>
	<p>JSLess allows you to write custom JavaScript and jQuery behaviors and reuse them throughout an application. Itâ€™s primary purpose was to cut down on the amount of JavaScript written while developing a single page application or any other dynamic website.</p>
	<p>JSLess is made up of a ton of pieces &amp; parts. It uses some advanced <a href="https://github.com/realstrategos/JSLess/blob/master/jsless.js#L802" target="_blank">parsing techniques</a>, <a href="https://github.com/realstrategos/JSLess/blob/master/jsless.js#L71" target="_blank">form processing (AJAX)</a>, as well as a ton of other magic to do <a href="https://github.com/realstrategos/JSLess/blob/master/jsless.js#L958" target="_blank">jQuery behaviors</a> such as "show" or "hide" or POST a form to the database via AJAX.</p>
	<p>My role in JSLess involves creating/maintaining the documentation, writing behaviors, and contributing to the framework along the way.</p>
