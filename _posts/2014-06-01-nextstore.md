	<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
	<p>After finishing the <a href="http://ruleofnext.com" target="_blank">Rule of Next</a> website, next on their list of to-dos for their online presence was to create an online store. Once again the art direction came from Rule of Nextâ€™s Creative Director. I set up the store for them, brought the idea to fruition, and made it a fully functional store for them to manage after deployment. It is currently managed by the staff at Next.</p>
	<p>The project was primarily done using HTML5, CSS3, and Big Cartel for the store's inventory management.</p>
