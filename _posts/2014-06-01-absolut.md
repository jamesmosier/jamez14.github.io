	<p><a href="http://absolutteamtravel.com" target="_blank">Absolut Team Travel</a> was designed and developed for a Bizdom backed start up business headquartered in Wooster, Ohio. The main goal was to create an online presence for existing and potential clients as the business grows at a rapid pace.</p>
	<p>The website's main goal was clean and easy to find information. I designed the site using Bootstrap 3.0 as well as PHP/WordPress for the content management system.</p>
