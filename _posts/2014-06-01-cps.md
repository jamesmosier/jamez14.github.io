	<p><a href="http://creativepaintingandstenciling.com" target="_blank">Creative Painting and Stenciling</a> by Jeanette Mosier is my moms personal website for her business. She has been painting/stenciling for over 15 years and up until 2011, she did not have a website. The current design and architecture is the second iteration of her website.</p>
	<p>The project was primarily done using AngularJS, Bootstrap 3, and jQuery, along with PHP for the contact form.</p>
