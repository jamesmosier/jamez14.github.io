	<p>While working with Stream 9, one particular project that stands out is the <a href="http://www.cpl.org/2012annual/index.html" target="_blank">Cleveland Public Libraries Annual Report</a> that they create each year. I was tasked with turning the Photoshop files for the project into a fully functional website for the 2012 annual report.</p> 
	<p>The project was comprised of jQuery, HTML &amp; CSS. The animation on the front page is a jQuery animation while the remainder of the site is static HTML/CSS.</p>
