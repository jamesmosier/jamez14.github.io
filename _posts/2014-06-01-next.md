	<p><a href="http://ruleofnext.com" target="_blank">Rule of Next</a> has five lifestyle boutiques throughout the NE Ohio area.</p> 
	<p>I worked with the Creative Director on the look &amp; feel of the website â€“ in which he had a clear vision of how it should look. I presented some basic wireframes and once approved, worked on top of their existing WordPress site to execute the project. The site is now primarily managed by the Rule of Next staff.</p>
	<p>The project was primarily done using HTML5, CSS3, and WordPress.</p>
